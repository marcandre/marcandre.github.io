    - title: Ruby AST Pattern Compiler
      link: "https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop-ast/pull/105"
      tagline: |
        RuboCop has a [DSL to match parsed Ruby code](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop-ast/blob/master/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/node_pattern.adoc).
        I rewrote it using a lexer / parser / compiler for
        more flexibility.

        Here is a [technical description of the compiler](https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop-ast/1.2/node_pattern_compiler.html).

        I also [wrote a playground](https://nodepattern.herokuapp.com/) for it.

      tagline: |
        The Ruby [`parser` gem](https://github.com/whitequark/parser/#parser) includes a tool to alter code.

        I [proposed an improved design](https://github.com/whitequark/parser/issues/401)
        and implemented it using [an immutable tree of nested intervals](https://github.com/whitequark/parser/pull/403/files)
    - title: Elixir Exercises
