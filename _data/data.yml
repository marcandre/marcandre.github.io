    - title: Elixir Contributions
      link: "https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amarcandre"
      tagline: |
        I contributed to Elixir's compiler to reduce recompilations:

        * Have `@behaviour` introduce a runtime dependency instead of compile-time ([PR](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/12103))
        * Do not recompile unless content of files has actually changed ([PR](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/11080))
        * Improve `mix xref graph` to identify problematic dependencies ([PR](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/11044), [etc.](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/11943))

        These are good examples of my capacity to delve into foreign codebases (even those like Elixir's
        compiler that are hard to read) to make improvements.
    - title: Ruby AST Pattern Compiler
      link: "https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop-ast/pull/105"
      tagline: |
        RuboCop has a [DSL to match parsed Ruby code](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop-ast/blob/master/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/node_pattern.adoc).
        I rewrote it using a lexer / parser / compiler to
        allow me to add more powerful patterns and implement introspection.

        Here is a [technical description of the compiler](https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop-ast/1.2/node_pattern_compiler.html).

        I also [wrote a playground](https://nodepattern.herokuapp.com/) for it.
    - title: Ruby Parser Rewriter
      link: "https://github.com/whitequark/parser/issues/401"
      tagline: |
        The Ruby [`parser` gem](https://github.com/whitequark/parser/#parser) includes a tool to alter code.

        I [proposed an improved design](https://github.com/whitequark/parser/issues/401)
        and implemented it using [an immutable tree of nested intervals](https://github.com/whitequark/parser/pull/403)
