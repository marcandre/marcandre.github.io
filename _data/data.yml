        As a co-founder, partner and board member,
        I contributed to the upper management of Laser while it
        grew to 70 employees and 6 M$ of yearly revenue.
        As VP R&D, I was responsible for the design, implementation

        as the only developer. When I started full-time,
        I put in place a development and support team that grew
        to six people and assumed technical supervision of
        our system administrators and hardware support group.

    assignments:
      - title: Ruby AST Pattern Compiler
        link: "https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop-ast/pull/105"
        tagline: |
          RuboCop has a [DSL to match parsed Ruby code](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop-ast/blob/master/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/node_pattern.adoc).
          I rewrote it using a lexer / parser / compiler for
          more flexibility.

          [Here is a technical description of the compiler](https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop-ast/1.2/node_pattern_compiler.html)

          I also [wrote a playground](https://nodepattern.herokuapp.com/).
      - title: Ruby Parser Rewriter
        link: "https://github.com/whitequark/parser/pull/403/files"
        tagline: |
          The Ruby [`parser`](https://github.com/whitequark/parser/#parser) gem includes a tool to alter code.

          I [proposed an improved design](https://github.com/whitequark/parser/issues/401)
          and implemented it using [an immutable tree of nested intervals](https://github.com/whitequark/parser/pull/403/files)
      - title: Elixir Exercises
        link: "https://exercism.io/profiles/marcandre"
        tagline: |
          I enjoyed solving some exercises on `exercism.io`.
